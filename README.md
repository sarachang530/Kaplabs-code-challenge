# Kaplabs-code-challenge

In this app that I have built, it utilizes two apis. One from thecatapi.com which allows use to see a random cat picture everytime we refresh and another from the potter api which allows use to see which house we put into.

Sometimes you are feeling down or just want to feel magical, what better way than to cheer you up with some random cute kittie/cat pics that you can take along with you to start your magical journey at hogwarts!
